	"""Commands that configure the permissions for particular pages or the entire server.

	The permissions system in this bot works like so.
	There are three roles any member can be in: everyone (the default), Verified, or Moderator.
	Of these, Verified and Moderator can be tied to a role on your server.
	When a role is set, everyone in that role will have the permissions of it, as determined by the server's
	default permissions and individual page permission overrides.

	Permissions have a hierarchy: none (no permissions), view, edit, and delete, with later permissions including
	all earlier permissions. For example, anyone who can edit a page can also view it, but cannot delete it.

	For example:
	- "head honcho" is configured as the moderator role
	- Riley has this role.
	- The server's default permissions are set to: everyone=edit, verified=edit, moderator=delete
	- The permission overrides for page "smoke on the water" are everyone=view, verified=view, moderator=edit

	In this situation, Riley can delete, edit, and view any page,
	except for "smoke on the water", which they can only edit.
